                  competitor whose highest scoring top yields the greatest number of points. Should
                  competitors&apos; highest scoring top be the same, the next highest scoring top
                  will be considered, and so on until there is a difference between the tied
                  competitors. If competitors remain tied after considering all previous rounds, the
                  tie will stand, and competitors will share the same rank.
